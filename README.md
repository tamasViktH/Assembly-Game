# 🎮 Assembly Endgame – Typing Challenge to Save the Programming World

**Assembly Endgame** is a fast-paced React typing game built during the Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path. Your mission: eliminate programming languages one by one by guessing their names, letter by letter — but each wrong guess brings you closer to digital doom!

## 🧠 Gameplay

- A random programming language is selected (e.g., CSS, React, Python)
- Guess the word by selecting letters on the virtual keyboard
- Every incorrect letter adds a 💀 icon (mistake counter)
- Win by revealing the full word before running out of lives
- Minimal UI, quick feedback, and satisfying challenge
